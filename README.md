Hit me up if you want to team up for a tech event! My other passions include content curation, writing articles, and making new acquaintnaces. 
I am very inclined in working with Free and open source technology for most of needs, as I personally believe that any and all kinds of Knowlegde and information should be freely accessible to those passionate. I have previously worked on projects involving Decentralised Blockchain based applications. My fields of interest includes Data Science, Blockchain and Mobile Application Development. 

I live by the code " If life gives you an Antelopes, hope for a GNU".
